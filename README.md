# Hvesser-Lewis Portfolio

This repository is the frontend code for my personal portfolio website. The site is hosted at [hvesserlewis.com](https://hvesserlewis.com).

I plan to keep this code as an open-source project, for others to look at and use as a template for their own porfolio sites if they find it interesting.

The site is still in development, namely the blog is still not functional in the latest version.

## Tech Stack

Built with `Next.js` using `TypeScript` and `TailwindCSS`. It follows a conventional structure and application architecture.
